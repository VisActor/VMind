    text: `From 2016 until late last year. The Bank of Japan even began what's called yield curve control, which essentially involved buying up enough debt to guarantee that government borrowing costs wouldn't go above a certain level. Japan's ultra loose monetary policy came under pressure in 2022 when inflation started rising across the world. Usually, central banks raise interest rates, but the bank of Japan decided not to, both because inflation was relatively low in Japan, but also because thanks to its enormous debt burden, even a slight raise in interest rates would translate to a massive increase in debt servicing costs, especially for the Japanese government. Unfortunately, things have become more difficult as other central banks have raised rates, making their currencies relatively more attractive and sparking a decline in the yen. In the last year, the yen has fallen from about 130 to the dollar to a 34 year low of 160 to the dollar on Monday. Now the speed and severity of this decline presents a difficult dilemma for the bank of Japan because thanks to Japan's reliance on imports, it sparked significant inflation in essential items like food and energy. But they still don't want to raise rates for the reasons we've just mentioned earlier. This is why on Monday evening, instead of raising rates, the bank of Japan used billions of dollars worth of Japan's foreign exchange reserves to buy up the yen on the international market, artificially inflating its value. While this seems to have worked in the short term, as of Tuesday morning, the yen is now trading at nearer 155 to the dollar. It's both expensive and fundamentally unsustainable. Even if the bank of Japan has some of the largest foreign exchange reserves in the world. All in all, assuming the bank of Japan won't engage in significant rate hikes, this means that the yen is very much dependent on what goes on in the rest of the world. If inflation comes down and other central banks start cutting rates, then this will reduce some of the pressure on the yen. But if inflation turns out to be stickier than we'd like, which seems to be the case, then the divergence between the bank of Japan and other central banks will persist, which means more downward pressure on the yen. If this happens, then the bank of Japan won't be able to stave off the yen's decline with exchange reserves forever. And eventually, they'll have to choose a horn of their uncomfortable dilemma, either to just accept the yen's decline and all the inflation related political turmoil that comes with it all, raise rates and just hope that the world's most debt burdened economy can somehow deal with it.`,

In fact, a highly efficient dark store can do a better gross merchandise value per square foot than a highly organized supermarket like Dmart. So while a dark store or blanket can do a GMV of 90,000 rupees per square fit, Mart can only do a GMV of 47,000 rupees per square fit. But how does this work? See, these stores are like supermarkets, but have no Hawkins, which means that only rider can go and collect stuff from there. These stores have a lot of inventory that comes from Mother Warehouse store, which is located in the outskirts. So to give you context, for every 40 dark stores located in the city, there is always a mother warehouse, which is located at the outskirts or city. And that is more than 10 times big as a dark store, which is about 20,000 to 1 lax, 75,000 square feet big. It is super huge. And companies don't set dark stores everywhere, by the way. They are smartly set based on multiple parameters like average household income of the area, peak time traffic of the area, infrastructure structure of the area, and also the population density. Also, there's usually about a staff of 25 to 30 people who are working in three shifts in these dark stores who would take care of the packaging. And as we've discussed earlier as well in the video, that the operating cost for a dark store comes at about rupees 22 for each order.

If we start with sales volume, we can see the existing home market has a sales pace of roughly 3.7 million homes per year, while the new home market has a sales pace of 619,000 homes per year. Right off the bat, we can see how the existing home market is almost six times larger than the new construction market in terms of sales volume. Both of these markets, existing and new, have seen a huge reduction in sales volume or buyer demand since interest rates have increased, as affordability is out of reach for most people. If we take this annual sales pace and divided by 12, we can get an idea of the average sales pace per month. Of course, there are seasonal patterns, but if we normalize for those effects, we can see that the current monthly sales pace in the existing home market is roughly 309,000, and the new construction market is selling about 51,000 homes per month. At the peak of the housing boom during the pandemic, the existing hallmark had a sales pace of 500,000 units per month and the new construction market was selling nearly 90,000 units per month. Now that we have an idea of the current level of demand, we have to look at supply or the level of inventory for sale in the existing home market. There are currently 1.1 million homes for sale, one of the lowest on record. If we just look at inventory alone. In the new construction market, there are 479,000 units for sale, one of the highest levels on record, only surpassed by the housing bubble of 2007.`,

On the flip side, a high level of month's supply means there's too much inventory and prices must fall. The existing home market has a month supply of 3.7, which is very low, but it's been increasing since the absolute historic level of one point six in January 2022. Never in the history of the US housing market has the month's supply of existing homes been that low. This created a very unhealthy situation in the existing home market. The inventory situation in the existing hall market is still very tight, but it's now at the highest level since before for the pandemic.

This shows the month's supply for the total US housing market by year. 2024 is a partial year, and the current level as of May 2024 is also noted in the chart. As of May 2024, the total month supply situation is 4.5, which it hasn't been since 2015. You can also see the four years where the total month supply was below 4.0, which is extremely tight. And you can also see the 2021 situation at 2.6, which was crazy unhealthy. One major point is that this current 4.5 level is the national average. But as we know, real estate is very regional. So this means that there are some markets that are near a month supply of 6 and feeling downward price pressure, while some markets are still down at 3 and seeing prices rise with multiple offers. The new home market with a month supply of 9.3 is way above the balance level of six point zero, and there are price cuts and discounts in that market.`,

    text: `In June, the National Association of homebuilders reported that 29% of builders cut home prices with an average price reduction of 6%. And 61% of builders use sales incentives like mortgage rate ByteDance to boost sales. But we need to talk about the new hall market and the 9.3 month supply level in a bit more detail, because there is more than what meets BI in the new construction market. Currently, there are 479,000 units for sale in the new construction market and a current pace of sales of about 50 thousand per month. In the new home market, a home could be listed for sale when it's completed, under construction or not yet started. If we look at the percentage of inventory that is completed, we can see that of those 479,000 new home units for sale, Only 20% are completed, which means 80% are either under construction or not yet started.`,

    text: `The level of completed new home inventory for sale fell below 10% during the most acute part of the US housing shortage. Normally, in between 20% and 30% of new construction inventory is completed. During really bad downturns like 2008, builders were sitting on almost 50% completed inventory, which is what led to dramatic price cuts and big layoffs of construction crews. The level of completed inventory is now back into the normal range at 20%, and it's rising, which means that if we move towards 30%, price cuts will get more intense and construction crews will be at high risk of job losses. If we take the current 50,000 new home sales pace and divide that by the amount of completed new home inventory for sale. We can see that there's currently about 1.9 months of completed inventory for sale, which is getting past the average level and into the range consistent with recessions and job losses for construction crews. If the home builders have a lot of completed new home inventory for sale, they aren't going to apply for new building permits and build even more homes. And that's exactly what we're starting to see.`,

There has to be a level playing field for American companies competing in China. In the early 2 Chinese factories like this one pumped out clothes and flags and cars. The sticker prices were cheap. But there was another price to be paid, American jobs. Every single employee of this plant, we'll be out of work by January. 15 years and almost 6 million jobs later, economists are debating what price another wave of imports could exact from American workers. But two key differences between then and now may have a new effect on the US economy. Look at this line. Before 2001, American manufacturing employed over 17 million people, making toys, furniture, paper goods and much more. Then word began to circulate that China was joining the World Trade Organization. And here's what it did. Joining the WTO meant China faced fewer tariffs and restrictions from its trading partners, and the result was dubbed the China.`,

But this lighter blue region here was largely spared. It's called Auto Alley. The main reason it succeeded where, say, Silicon Valley's manufacturing failed, is due to investment from competitors like Japan.`,

    text: 'Snap’s latest AR glasses aren’t its first hardware product. The company has a history of experimenting with hardware and has launched smart glasses under the brand name Spectacles. However, the company has struggled to make money from selling hardware. It first debuted a pair of smart glasses in 2016; the $130 device made it easy for users to capture short, first-person videos that they could post on Snapchat. However, the product failed, and the company had to write down $40 million due to losses from unsold Spectacles. Snap once again tried to sell new Spectacles smart glasses in 2019—this time a more premium version for $380—but that too didn’t take off. In 2021, it unveiled new glasses with advanced AR capabilities, but instead of selling them to consumers, the company sold the device to developers, hinting that the glasses were more of a prototype than an actual consumer product. Beyond glasses, Snap also tried to sell a flying drone for $230, but that device was abruptly discontinued after just a few months',
