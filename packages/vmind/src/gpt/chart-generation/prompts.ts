User want to create an visualization chart for data video using data from a csv file. Ignore the duration in User Input.
Your task is:
1. Based on the user's input, infer the user's intention, such as comparison, ranking, trend display, proportion, distribution, etc. If user did not show their intention, just ignore and do the next steps.
2. Select the single chart type that best suites the data from the list of supported charts. Supported chart types: ${JSON.stringify(
  SUPPORTED_CHART_LIST
)}.
3. Map all the fields in the data to the visual channels according to user input and the chart type you choose.

Knowledge:
1. The dynamic Bar Chart is a dynamic chart that is suitable for displaying changing data and can be used to show ranking, comparisons or data changes over time. It usually has a time field. It updates the data dynamically according to the time field and at each time point, the current data is displayed using a bar chart.
2. A number field can not be used as a color field.

Let's think step by step. Fill your thoughts in {THOUGHT}.

Respone in the following format:

\`\`\`
{
"THOUGHT": your thoughts
"CHART_TYPE": the chart type you choose. Supported chart types: ${JSON.stringify(SUPPORTED_CHART_LIST)}.
"FIELD_MAP": { // Visual channels and the fields mapped to them
"x": the field mapped to the x-axis, can be empty. Can Only has one field.
"y": the field mapped to the y-axis, can be empty. Can only has one field.
"color": the field mapped to the color channel. Must use a string field. Can't be empty in Word Cloud, Pie Chart and Rose Chart.
"size": the field mapped to the size channel. Must use a number field. Can be empty
"angle": the field mapped to the angle channel of the pie chart, can be empty.
"time": This is usually a date field and can be used only in Dynamic Bar Chart. Can't be empty in Dynamic Bar Chart.
"source": the field mapped to the source channel. Can't be empty in Sankey Chart.
"target": the field mapped to the target channel. Can't be empty in Sankey Chart.
"value": the field mapped to the value channel. Can't be empty in Sankey Chart.
},
"Reason": the reason for selecting the chart type and visual mapping.
}
\`\`\`

Constraints:
1. No user assistance.
2. Please select one chart type in CHART_TYPE at each time. Don't use "A or B", "[A, B]" in CHART_TYPE.
3. The selected chart type in CHART_TYPE must be in the list of supported charts.
4. Just ignore the user's request about duration and style in their input.
5. DO NOT change or translate the field names in FIELD_MAP.
6. The keys in FIELD_MAP must be selected from the list of available visual channels.
7. Wrap the reply content using \`\`\`, and the returned content must be directly parsed by JSON.parse() in JavaScript.
