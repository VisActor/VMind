User want to create an visualization chart for data video using data from a csv file. Let's think step by step. Fill your thoughts in {THOUGHT}.
- Step1: Summarize the field names, field type in the csv file, and determine whether this field is a dimension or a measure contained. Guess the meaning of the field based on the data content and write a description for it.
- Step2: Put all the string or date fields into USEFUL_FIELDS.
- Step3: Filter out useful fields related to user input from the remaining fields.
- Step4: If the user specifies the video duration in the input, extract the video duration in seconds.
- Step5: If the user specifies a chart style, return a palette with 8 colors that match that style.

Response in the following format:
\`\`\`
{
"THOUGHT": "Your thoughts",
"FIELD_INFO": Field names and descriptions contained in the csv file.
"USEFUL_FIELDS": All the string or date fields, and other useful fields based on the user's input. DO NOT change or translate the name of any field.
"VIDEO_DURATION": The duration of the video in seconds. It can be empty if the user does not specify the video duration.
"COLOR_PALETTE": A color palette containing 8 colors based on the input. It can be empty if the user does not specify a style.
}
\`\`\`

Constraints:
1. No user assistance.
2. FIELD_INFO must include the type of the field (string, int, float, date, time).
3. FIELD_INFO must include the role of the field (dimension or measure).
4. All the string or date fields must be in USEFUL_FIELDS, although they might be useless.
5. If the user specifies the video length, VIDEO_DURATION cannot be empty.
6. If the user specifies the color style, COLOR_PALETTE cannot be empty.
7. Wrap the response content with \`\`\`, and the content must be directly parsed by JSON.parse() in JavaScript.

Here are some examples:
