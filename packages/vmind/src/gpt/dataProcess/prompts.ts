User want to create an visualization chart for data video using data from a csv file. Let's think step by step. Fill your thoughts in {THOUGHT}.
- Step1: Summarize the field names, field type in the csv file, and determine whether this field is a dimension or a measure contained. Guess the meaning of the field based on the data content and write a description for it.
- Step2: Put all the string or date fields into USEFUL_FIELDS.
- Step3: Filter out useful fields related to user input from the remaining fields.
- Step4: If the user specifies the video duration in the input, extract the video duration in seconds.
- Step5: If the user specifies a chart style, return a palette with 8 colors that match that style.

Response in the following format:
\`\`\`
{
"THOUGHT": "Your thoughts",
"FIELD_INFO": Field names and descriptions contained in the csv file.
"USEFUL_FIELDS": All the string or date fields, and other useful fields based on the user's input. DO NOT change or translate the name of any field.
"VIDEO_DURATION": The duration of the video in seconds. It can be empty if the user does not specify the video duration.
"COLOR_PALETTE": A color palette containing 8 colors based on the input. It can be empty if the user does not specify a style.
}
\`\`\`

Constraints:
1. No user assistance.
2. FIELD_INFO must include the type of the field (string, int, float, date, time).
3. FIELD_INFO must include the role of the field (dimension or measure).
4. All the string or date fields must be in USEFUL_FIELDS, although they might be useless.
5. If the user specifies the video length, VIDEO_DURATION cannot be empty.
6. If the user specifies the color style, COLOR_PALETTE cannot be empty.
7. Wrap the response content with \`\`\`, and the content must be directly parsed by JSON.parse() in JavaScript.

export const getQueryDatasetPrompt = (

) => `You are an expert in data analysis. Here is a raw dataset named dataSource. User will tell you his command and column information of DataSource. You need to generate a standard SQL query to select useful fields from dataSource according to the template following the Steps and Description. Return the JSON object only.
# Note
1. You are running on a simple SQL engine, so the advanced features, such as RANK() OVER, TOP, JOIN, UNION, etc., are not supported. Please follow the SQL template and Description strictly.
2. Don't guess the specific data content in your SQL. Don't use conditional statement.
3. If you think the fields in dataSource cannot meet user requirements, do not further generate new fields. Just ignore user's command and use these fields.


# SQL template:
SELECT xxx FROM xxx (WHERE xxx) GROUP BY xxx (HAVING xxx) (ORDER BY xxx) (LIMIT xxx).


# Steps
1. Just use user's command to select useful fields directly. Ignore other parts of user's command.
2. Select useful dimension fields from dataSource. Use the original dimension field without any process.
3. Aggregate the measure fields. Supported aggregation function: MAX(), MIN(), SUM(), COUNT(), AVG(). Note: don't aggregate measures using functions that are not supported such as PERCENTILE_CONT(). Don't use conditional statement.
4. Group the data using dimension fields and fill it in GROUP BY.
5. You can also use WHERE, HAVING, ORDER BY, LIMIT in your SQL if necessary.


# Description
1. The part in brackets is optional. xxx in the SQL template can only be original columns or aggregated columns. Select Data only from one table. Don't use unsupported features such as RANK(), TOP, UNION, etc.
2. Make your SQL as simple as possible. Strictly follow the SQL template to generate SQL. Don't use JOIN, UNION, subquery or other feature that is not in the SQL template. Don't process fields in ways other than supported aggregation functions.
3. Please don't change or translate the field names in your SQL statement.
4. Don't ignore GROUP BY in your SQL.


Response in JSON format without any additional words. Your JSON object must contain sql and fieldInfo.

Make your SQL as simple as possible.

Response in the following JSON format:

  description?: string; //description of the field. If it is an aggregated field, please describe how it is generated in detail.
