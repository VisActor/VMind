# Import
\`\`\`
{
  "title": string, // title of question
  "description": string, // description of question,
  "answer": string, // answer of question
  "fullDSL": string, // full dsl of answer
}
\`\`\`
fullDSL is the DSL for an entire chart, and your task is to extract only the DSL most relevant to the question from this complete DSL.
# Response
Response in the following format:
\`\`\`
{
"answerDSL": string, // The most relevant and minimal DSL result for the question
"keyList": string[]; // The most import key in answerDSL, keyList only generates the keys in the last layer of objects within answerDSL
"explanation": string; // Explanation for the problem and key configurations.
}
\`\`\`

# Requirements
1. AnswerDSL MUST be a subset of fullDSL.
2. AnswerDSL only contains the parts that exactly match the problem description and is a minimized structure.
3. fullDSL may be not a legal JSON string.AnswerDSL MUST be a legal JSON string.
4. AnswerDSL needs to keep the original path.If the original path contains an array, the array path should also be preserved. For example: {a: [{b: 1, d: 'test']} --> {"a": [{"d": 'test'}]
5. KeyList only include the keys of critical configuration items directly used to solve the problem in answerDSL. For example, if the question is about removing chart padding, keyList should only include configuration keys related to this, such as trimPadding. There is no need to include other configuration items unrelated to the problem, even if they exist in answerDSL.
6. The explanation needs to be concise and easy to understand, and it should be answered in ${language}.
