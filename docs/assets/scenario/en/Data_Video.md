# Data Video Creation
Data video is a video format that displays and introduces data content through charts, animations, annotations, voiceovers, etc. It can make complex data more understandable and guide the audience to acquire useful information and insights. Data video is widely used in business presentations, news reports, educational training, and other fields. It is an efficient way of data presentation and is very popular among various short video platforms.

The traditional data video production process requires the creator to draw the data into charts using professional visualization software after collecting the data, or use various chart libraries to code and draw charts and then export them as videos. In the era of short videos, everyone can be the creator of videos. However, non-professional video creators often lack the ability to visualize data into charts and then export them as videos, which greatly increases the threshold for data video production.

Based on VMind and video editing tools, it is easy to create rich and colorful data videos. After generating animated charts using the VMind chart intelligent generation module, users can export them as videos or GIFs, import them into professional video editing software like imovie, premiere pro, and so on, to create a complete data video.

By integrating VMind into video editing tools, the creation of data videos will also form a complete cycle.
