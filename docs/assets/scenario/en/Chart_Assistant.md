# Chart Intelligence Assistant
VMind can serve as a visual agent for large language models, responsible for tasks such as chart generation and chart editing, thereby creating a "Chart Intelligence Assistant". This assistant can serve as an independent robot, or it can be integrated into other products in the form of a Copilot.

As a chart intelligence assistant, VMind can generate corresponding charts based on the natural language description entered by the user. It can also realize secondary filtering, aggregation, and sorting of data through the intelligent data aggregation module.

Whether you need to display a time series line chart or a bar chart of different categories, VMind can quickly respond and help you select the chart type and generate the chart. With VMind, users can create both aesthetically pleasing and information-rich charts without in-depth chart design knowledge, greatly improving work efficiency.
