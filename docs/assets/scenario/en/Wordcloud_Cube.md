# Visual Narration - Word Cloud Cube
VisActor has been consistently dedicated to exploring the application of data visualization in narrative scenarios. VMind will also be combined with VChart narrative template to launch the intelligent narrative function.

We have combined VMind with the Coze platform to launch the Word Cloud Cube robot. Users only need to upload the title and core words of the word cloud, and VMind will intelligently generate personalized word clouds of various themes for users.

Although VMind itself has the ability to automatically infer chart types based on data and intelligently generate species, constraints need to be added to the results under the scenario of Word Cloud Cube. The VMind node service has encapsulated the VMind component, only allowing VMind to choose and generate from our specified word cloud template.

In the future, we will add a variety of theme templates, such as holidays, zodiacs, etc., to provide more possibilities and inspirations for users' creations. At the same time, we will also support the generation of GIF animations, allowing the word cloud to show a unique dynamic effect, giving it stronger visual impact and expressiveness.

Of course, we will also break through the limitations of word clouds and upgrade the Word Cloud Cube to a "Card Cube" which can create with a wider range and more stunning effects. In the meantime, we will also promote the overall upgrade of VMind to make it more intelligent, achieve qualitative improvement in all aspects such as code generation, chart configuration, automatic beautification, story arrangement, and serve more developers through open source services.
